    <h1>About Banana Clicker</h1>
    <div id="urmomgae">
    <p>Banana Clicker is the brainchild of amatuer programmer Spencer, best known as javaspence online. He was experienced in building websites with HTML and CSS, but for a while did not touch on JavaScript. Then, having being a fanatic of the HTML5 game Cookie Clicker, he realized that JavaScript is the key to building games online. He went into this project thinking it would be a game made in Unity2D released on Steam or something, but he decided that that would be too hard. He made a prototype in Scratch, and then decided to start using the power of JavaScript to make his game. He realized his purpose to making this game had changed over the whole process. He wanted to make an incremental clicker game to teach himself JavaScript. And what continues to be worked on to this day is a result of his determination to learn to make video games and finish a project he was passionate about.
    
    Spencer himself lives in St. Louis as a minor with his family. He wants to go into the video game industry, and is working to get there with this project and others he plans to make in the future.
