# Banana Clicker - An Open Source piece of garbage
**Essentially Cookie Clicker but Bananas.**

I just wanted to make a clicker game so I made this. It is basically just Cookie Clicker, really no differences. I haven't really even finished this,
so I don't even know how it will end up.

## Release Log

### v0.0.1-pre-alpha: 
Was a prototype built on Scratch titled "Banana Bonanza". Was never officially released but is playable. I will maybe add the file in a different repo.

### v0.0.5-alpha: 
First official release, and built in HTML, CSS, and JS. Works just fine however there is no autoclick, so a big feature is missing.

### v0.1-alpha:
Second release, this time includes autoclick, which I neglected to mention in the release, but also includes achievements, which is pretty cool.

### v0.2-beta:
Looks much better and also includes a div element where you can see your unlocked achievements. That's about it.

### v0.3-beta:
Looks much cleaner with the gradients. Also localStorage now saves all your data. This should be the last beta release before 1.0.
